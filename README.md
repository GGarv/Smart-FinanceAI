## Introduction
SmartFinanceAI is an open-source AI-powered financial advisory application—an intelligent virtual assistant designed to offer support and information regarding financial matters through natural language conversations.

Harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), our goal is to improve the accessibility and efficiency of financial services. We provide a user-friendly interface, guided by prompts, to assist non-technical users in seeking personalized financial information, advice, or assistance.

Developed using Next.js, the application showcases prominent prompt assistance features, including a robust CRUD-based user profile and prompt post functionality. The system leverages a MongoDB database, implements NextAuth authentication, and integrates the LLM Model GPT 3.5  to enhance the functionality of the AI financial advisory platform.

The model is sourced from Hugging Face, utilizing their token for secure authorization. Additionally, we employ RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to enhance prompt responses, combining our dataset with outputs generated by the LLM Model for optimal results.
Using Voice Assistace message you can get your advise and can get summary of the advise  through voice if you aree in hurry to get your advise.

**Loading the document and splitting text:**
   - Loading the pdf file using PyPDFLoader and extracted text from the pdf 
   - Splitting the text into smaller chunks using langchain.text_splitter

**Text Embeddings:**
   - Text embeddings are generated using the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` class from `langchain_community.embeddings`.
   - The model used for embedding is 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2', and it is configured to run on the CPU.

**Converting to vectors and saving it**
   - Converted text to vector using FAISS class from langchain_community.vectorstores and then saving the data

# **Creating a RAG Using LangChain and FAISS**
- It creates a retriever using a vector store (`db1`). The retriever is configured for similarity search, enabling the retrieval of documents similar to a given query.

- Checking our vector database and see if it can retrieve similar chunks of content giving some prompt
- It is basically fetching the output of the prompt from the vector database only

# **Building an LLM Chain for Question-Answering**
- Fetching the api token from Open Ai and loading model from hugging face 
- Generaing prompt templates and then creating llm chain for answering of our prompt.

# **Creating a RAG Chain**
Creating a rag chain so that the model has context to the query/prompt
- A retriever is created from the vector store db1 using the as_retriever method.
- The retriever is configured for similarity search, aiming to retrieve the top 20 documents similar to a given query.
- A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chain is constructed using the rag_chain variable.
- The chain includes a retriever for providing context and a language model chain (llm_chain) for generating responses.
- The RAG chain is invoked with a specific query ("I want to start investing, give me some tips").
- The retriever in the chain fetches relevant documents based on similarity to the query.
- The language model chain (llm_chain) then generates responses based on the retrieved context and the given question.
**Speech Recognition**
The inclusion of speech recognition capabilities enhances user interaction. Users can communicate with the chatbot through voice commands, making the platform more accessible.
**Text Summarizers for Concise Information**
To deliver information effectively, text summarizers are employed. Users can receive concise summaries of financial advice, making the content easily digestible.
